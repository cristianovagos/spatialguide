### Info
SpatialGuide is an audio guide App for Android smartphones, which tracks the tourist location using the smartphone GPS position and provides interesting information 
in both text and audio format about points of interest using a spatialized audio effect (“3D audio”). 
For this to be possible the system will gather the tourist's head rotation to create a audible 3D audio effect, giving the illusion that the sound is actually coming from the point location.
